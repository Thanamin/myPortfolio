            I graduated as Software Developer from Generation Thailand. I have
            the courage to change, self-improvement, and learn to advance my
            career as a software developer seriously. I have 4 years of
            professional experience as a salesperson. It gave me the courage to
            face problems edit and coordinated with multiple parties to get the
            job done and from experience, I know the problem will be easier to
            fix if we don't work alone.
